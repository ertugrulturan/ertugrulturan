    <samp>Hi there, I'm Ertuğrul TURAN / [T13R][twitter] 👋</samp>

        My software adventure started when I wondered how games are made instead of playing games, years after I met the first computer in February 2009. So why haven’t you heard the name T13R a lot? I can say there are 2 reasons for this; 1) Since I didn’t feel the need to use a nick, I used my direct name/nick(ERTUGRUL) for many years. 2) Due to the fact that there are activities in foreign forums, I went to foreign forums and met with 2 different topics besides game systems. “Security” and “Hosting” along with this acquaintance, for some reasons that caught my attention, my field of interest completely turned to these areas. If I remember correctly, this meeting happened in 2015 and I am improving myself every day in these 2 fields with a new goal of knowledge. While focusing on linux local security systems in this interval, I started to focus on WAF/FIREWALL systems due to the http flood attacks and my Layer7 Firewall project, which we serve you today, started to form. When I met the R10, the development process started to turn into the marketing process. I am currently working as a security manager in a few private companies. Nice to meet you (:
